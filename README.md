This is a fork of https://github.com/ycheng517/ar4_ros_driver

All we are changing is adding some hacky code to allow for control of a servo gripper directly through the same USB interface as the AR4.
This is a custom addition. We simply added a gripper to pin 35 of the teensy. Many thanks to Yifei Cheng drastically simplifying the AR4 control process
